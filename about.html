    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a developer who enjoys building creative, user-friendly websites and applications. </p>
    
    <p>I’ve designed, implemented, and maintained production-grade systems using tech stacks like [Your stack: e.g., Node.js, Python, React, AWS]—always striving for performance and reliability.</p>
        
    <p>In my most recent role at [Example Company], I delivered a feature that reduced page load time by 30%, boosting user retention and satisfaction. I consistently leverage metrics to guide impactful engineering decisions (e.g. “optimized algorithms leading to a 30% reduction in processing time”)  .</p>

    <p>I thrive in collaborative, Agile environments, participating in daily stand-ups, pair programming, and sprint retrospectives to foster continuous improvement and high-quality releases.</p>
